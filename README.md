## Abstract
In Chinese culture, names are chosen with great care and are very meaningful. Previous research has indicated that names may also contribute to the way a person is perceived, makes decisions, and experiences life, with the uniqueness of a name playing a role in these outcomes. This paper aims to explore what factors contribute to the uniqueness of a name, and more specifically, how the uniqueness of a character changes over time. The parts per million (ppm) of characters in Chinese given names is used to indicate how unique a character is. This study presents visualization-based analysis to answer the research question. We found that the uniqueness of Chinese characters has increased over time, and that the average ppm of characters with the highest perceived valence, warmth, and competence has also increased. Our findings align with the cultural shift in China toward individuality due to the rise in globalization. This departure from the traditional emphasis on fulfilling family wishes during the naming process represents a societal transformation and an evolution in the significance of modern names.
